The travel is planning at next april. The purpose of the travel is visiting friends. I would like to do the travel by ferry. But If it is less practical, I would like to do the travel by air.\nResearchAgent > For your trip from London to Paris next April to visit friends, traveling by ferry is feasible but less practical than flying.\n\n**Travel by Ferry:**\nThere is no direct ferry service from London to Paris. You would need to take a train from London to a ferry port such as Dover, then take a ferry to a French port like Calais or Dieppe, and finally travel by train or other means to Paris. The entire journey by train and ferry can take around 11 hours, and may be more expensive than the Eurostar train or flying, especially if booked last minute. P&O Ferries operates from Dover to Calais, and DFDS Seaways offers routes from Dover to Calais and Dunkirk, as well as Newhaven to Dieppe.\n\n**Travel by Air:**\nFlying from London to Paris is a much more practical and quicker option. Flights typically take about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Several airlines, including British Airways, easyJet, Air France, and Vueling, offer direct flights from various London airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton, Southend) to Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) or Paris Orly (ORY). Prices can vary, but round-trip flights can be found for around $74 or even less if booked in advance.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven your purpose of visiting friends and the desire for practicality, flying is the recommended method of travel due to its significantly shorter travel time and convenience.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### End of The Code ###","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-29T08:59:07.289476Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-29T08:59:07.289792Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-29T08:59:07.295452Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-29T08:59:07.289770Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-29T08:59:07.294007Z"}}}]}
